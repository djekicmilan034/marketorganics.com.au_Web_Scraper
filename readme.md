The project was conceived as a Web Scraper application over the page https://shop.marketorganics.com.au/, and
storing data from the page in a csv file.

Before running the scripts, it is necessary to install the libraries found in requirements.txt.

By running the marketorganics_com_au.py script,
we start the Web Scraper over the page, and thus store the data in the csv file marketorganics_com_au.csv
